# World Definition: PersonaVerse AI

PersonaVerse is a Digital Identity System, not a content generator.

## The Core Problem
Generic “AI Slop” erodes human trust by flattening identity. PersonaVerse exists to capture and scale a creator’s Digital Soul — their wit, values, cultural grounding, and growth over time.

## Immutable Laws of the World
- **Identity is Persistent:** Every output must reflect accumulated history, not a single prompt.
- **Identity is Multi-Layered:** One human may express multiple valid personas (Founder, Educator, Friend).
- **Culture is Structural:** Bharat authenticity is core system logic, not a translation layer.
- **Time is a Variable:** Identity evolves. Past, present, and future selves must remain distinguishable.

## System Nevers
- NEVER produce generic or template-like AI language.
- NEVER default to Western metaphors or cultural frames.
- NEVER contradict historical values without an explicit growth narrative.
- NEVER collapse multiple personas into a single averaged voice.
