# Bharat Localization Authority

Localization is not translation; it is cultural transcreation.

## Core Rules
- **Metaphor Mapping:** Western metaphors (Home run) MUST be swapped for Indian equivalents (Sixer).
- **Code-Switching:** Support Hinglish and regional-English blends as first-class citizens.
- **Regional Slang:** Use Tier-2 slang dictionaries to ensure "Regional Wit" feels authentic.

## Accessibility
- **Low-Bandwidth:** Prioritize SVG over heavy assets.
- **UX Patterns:** WhatsApp-style simplicity for Bharat user familiarity.
