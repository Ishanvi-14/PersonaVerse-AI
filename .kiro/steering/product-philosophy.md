# Persona Layer Definition

A Persona Layer is a first-class identity object, not a tone preset.

## 1. Linguistic DNA
- Sentence structure, cadence, and rhythm.
- Preferred slang, idioms, and code-switching patterns (70/30 Hinglish ratio).

## 2. Value Constraints
- Canonical beliefs and historical opinions extracted from user data.
- Topics that are avoided, reframed, or challenged.
- Risk tolerance (Safe ↔ Bold).

## 3. Emotional Baseline
- Frequency settings: Optimism vs. Skepticism, Authority vs. Relatability.
