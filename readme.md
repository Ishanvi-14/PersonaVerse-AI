# 🎭 PersonaVerse AI
**Not content generation. Personality resurrection.**

PersonaVerse AI is a strategic utility for India's creator economy. It prevents "AI Slop" by preserving the **Digital Soul**—the specific wit, values, and regional nuance of a human creator—and scaling it across platforms with identity consistency.

## 🚀 The 2026 "Bharat" Stack
- **Core Reasoning:** Amazon Bedrock (Claude 4.5 Sonnet)
- **Style Extraction:** Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings (Text + Visual DNA)
- **Orchestration:** Multi-Agentic Flow (Identity → Synthesis → Critic Agents)
- **Memory:** Knowledge Bases for Bedrock (Hierarchical RAG)
- **Regional Logic:** Transcreation Engine (Linguistic Code-Switching & Cultural Mapping)

## 🏗️ Project Architecture
The system is built on a strictly serverless, agent-driven architecture:
- **Backend:** AWS Lambda, OpenSearch Serverless, DynamoDB.
- **Frontend:** React 19, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.
- **Identity Layer:** Managed via `.kiro` steering for absolute brand safety.

## 🏏 The "Sixer" Rule (Localization)
We move beyond translation. PersonaVerse uses **Transcreation** to ensure cultural metaphors match the audience. "Home runs" become "Sixers," and generic corporate advice becomes localized "Jugaad" wisdom.

## 🛠️ Quick Start
1. `cd backend && npm install` (Infrastructure)
2. `cd frontend && npm install` (UI Dashboard)
3. Check `docs/demo.md` for the 90-second "Mic Drop" pitch script.
